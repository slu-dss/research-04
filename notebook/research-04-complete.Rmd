## Introduction
This notebook extends our use of `knitr` and other reproducible research techniques discussed in the first three lessons.

## Dependencies
This notebook requires the following packages:

```{r load-packages}
# tidyverse packages
library(ggplot2)      # data plotting
library(magrittr)     # pipe operator
library(readr)        # read csv files

# other packages
library(here)         # file path management
library(janitor)      # frequency tables
library(knitr)        # support for document knitting
```

## Load Data and Modify Output
This notebook requires two data files from the `data/` folder, the `mpg.csv` data and the `starwars.csv` data.

```{r load-mpg-data, message = FALSE, results='hide'}
auto <- read_csv(here("data", "mpg.csv"))
```

```{r load-starwars-data, message = FALSE, results='hide'}
star <- read_csv(here("data", "starwars.csv"))
```

*The code chunks both include `results='hide'` syntax, that prevents their output from appearing in your knit document. The code, however, will appear!*

If there are specific messages, like `read_csv()` produces, these will be hidden as well.

## Inline Information
We can embed statistics, like the average highway fuel efficiency (`r mean(auto$hwy)`). We can round this to two digits so we get a shorter output using the `round()` function - `r round(mean(auto$hwy), digits = 2)`.

## Modifying Output with Images
There are two ways to include images. First, we can use pre-made images in our documents. For example, we could embed the SLU DSS logo. By including `echo=FALSE`, we supress the code from being included in our output document!

```{r static-image, out.width='25%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='DSS Logo', echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here("img", "logo.png"))
```

We could also add the SLU logo itself.

```{r static-image-2, out.width='25%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='SLU Logo', echo=FALSE}
include_graphics(here("img", "sluLogo.png"))
```

Or we could add a plot:

```{r create-plot-auto, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = auto, mapping = aes(hwy, cty)) +
  geom_point()
```

Or another plot:

```{r create-plot-star, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = star, mapping = aes(height, mass)) +
  geom_point()
```

This last plot adds a warning to our document, which we can supress with `warning=FALSE`.

## Adding Tables
If we want to create a simple frequency table, we can do that with the `janitor` package:

```{r simple-table, echo=FALSE}
auto %>%
  tabyl(class)
```

By using the `kable` function, we can improve the display of this table:

```{r nicer-table, echo=FALSE}
auto %>% 
  tabyl(class) -> tableClass

kable(tableClass)
```

This can also be used for arbitrary information:

```{r arbitrary-table, echo=FALSE}
kable(
  data.frame(
    name = c("Chris", "Christy"),
    program = c("Sociology", "Spanish")
  )
)
```

## Other formats
In order to switch to other formats, you need to edit the `YAML` header of your `.Rmd` file. You can choose from a variety of [document](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/documents.html) and [presentation](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/presentations.html) formats. 

We'll quickly adjust this notebook to knit as a word document instead of `html` notebooks and `.md` output files.

Change the `output:` line of your `YAML` to look like this:

```
output: word_document
```

When you knit, the word document will be created instead of the previous output types.

## Adding a Table of Contents
If we want to add a table of contents to this document, we can edit the `YAML` like so:

```
output:
  word_document:
    toc: true
    toc_depth: 2
```

## Citing References
To cite references, you need four components. First, you'll need a `.bib` file [or another bibligoraphy format](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_bibliographies_and_citations.html) saved in your `notebook/` directory. We've provided a sample `.bib` file, which uses LaTeX bibligoraphy styles that can be obtained from Google Scholar to populate our bibliography.

Second, you need to have edited the notebook header to include a bibligography reference:

```
bibliography: bibliography.bib
```

Third, you need to include an in-text reference. For example, we could discuss the book *R for Data Science* [@wickham2016r]. We use the brackets and `@` to indicate that we want to make an in-text citation. We can also talk about an author's work, like Xie's recent work [-@xie2018r]. Or we can talk about an author's work on a specific page, like @wickham2016r [p. 62].

Fourth, we need to add a final heading at the bottom of the file titled `## References` or `## Works Cited`.
